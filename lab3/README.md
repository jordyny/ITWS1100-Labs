In this lab, I created a website using HTML and CSS. The website was created using VS Code. 

Credits and Websites Used:
Spacing, fonts, shadows - StackOverflow
Fonts - Google Fonts

Chosen methods according to own preference and guidelines. Also chosen with intention to expand upon the website in the future after learning how to implement JavaScript into the website and/or animate certain aspects of the website.
