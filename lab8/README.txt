This lab required me to dynamically rebuild my projects page using JavaScript, jquery, and JAX. 

Some issues I encountered were the paths and directories that I had to input from the json file and my projects.html file.
I also had to do some more research on using jQuery to add functionality to my website of showing/hiding labs
