In this website, I learned that you can use an event like DOMContentLoaded to ensure that JS runs only 
when the html doc is parsed and the dom is fully constructed. it was after I implemented this that the code worked
 
I also used https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/sel_focus.php
to see how to use the focus selector for crime 4

I used https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event
to see how to do the extra credit portion of highlighting the first box on first load


In this Lab(5), I started my first use of JavaScript and implemented the onclick function, the alert() function, solved 
the crimes by using for in the div tag as well as using the focus selector to highlight the input boxes.
