NOTE: Lab9.html in lab3 folder

Sources Used: Previous lab 7 js file provided

In this lab, I created RSS and Atom Feeds dynamically using JavaScript, JSON 
Files, AJAX, and jQuery to style the page (Hide and Show Feed Features). I made the path
in the JavaScript file to the lab9 html file. 

Overall, this lab was easy since the syntax was fairly similar to lab 8, only
the type of file was changed, the elements were changed, and the paths differed.
